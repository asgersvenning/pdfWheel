Title: On Demand Embedding of Large PDFs in Rmarkdown Documents and Shiny Apps

Description: A fast and easy way to embed pdfs in Rmarkdown documents or Shiny apps.
    The package does not have any dependencies, but instead relies on custom javascript and css to render the pdfs.
    The package is inspired by the "slickR" package, but instead of using the slick carousel, which cannot handle large pdfs,
    it relies on the user to split the pdf into pages, and then embeds the pages as images as needed. This makes it possible to
    embed large pdfs in Rmarkdown documents and Shiny apps, without creating a large html file with many hidden images.
Imports:
    rjson,
    htmlwidgets
